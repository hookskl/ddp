Shiny Gadgets provide a way to use Shiny's interactivity and user interface tools as a part of a data analysis. 

* create functions that opens a small Shiny app within RStudio
* use the `miniUI` package for creating user interfaces.

At its core a Shiny Gadget is a function that launches a small (single-page) Shiny application. These gadgets are meant to be displayed in the RStudio viewer pane. 

## Advantages

* Shiny gadgets are functions, and they can take values as arguments and return values
* this means they are more simple to create (no separate `ui.R` and `server.R` files required)
